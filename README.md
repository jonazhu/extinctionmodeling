# Extinction Modeling
Models developed for 02-731 Modeling Evolution at CMU by Jonathan Zhu, Leila Michal, Nathruvan Rammohan, and Andres Chousal. These models aim to expand on mathematical models of when natural selection prevents extinction by introducing factors more related to extinction.

Directory structure:
- q1_gradualdecline focuses on the gradual decline in suitability of a habitat (i.e., a gradual rather than abrupt decline in fitness)
- q2_invadingspecies focuses on two species in tandem with each other, where the fitness of one species depends in part on the frequency of the other
- more to come...
