    "In this notebook, we will be taking a different approach to looking at extinction. Here, we'll rescue a group of individuals that are at a critical density and look to see if genetic diversity can be recovered within this population. \n",
    "\n",
    "To model this, we'll assign a linear vector of SNPs to each individual. Each element in the vector is 0, 1, or 2 which corresponds to the number of mutant polymorphisms in the genome at that position. For example, if we have a G -> A mutation, we would put 0 for GG, 1 for GA or AG, or 2 for AA. This linear vector is based on a pair of binary vectors of the same length, which determines whether that SNP is the mutant on a specific homolog. The 0, 1, 2 vector is obviously calculated then by element-wise adding the two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a population can be modeled as a matrix. The model will randomly generate a matrix or take in an input matrix from the user. What it needs to take in, however, is either a distance array or an LD array. For $n$ SNPs, this means an $n-1$ length vector of either base pair distances or LD values between the SNPs. That is, the 0th element of the linkage array corresponds to the linkage between the 0th and 1st SNPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "New individuals are created by choosing two individuals. For each parent, we 50/50 start with one of the two homologs, then pick the next mutant based on the provided distance/linkage disequilibrium. This goes until the end of the vector. The two vectors are then combined to make the new individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume no other mutations, and that all parents die after each reproduction period, so all new individuals in the next generation are good. We also assume linear growth from provided critical number to provided thriving population number, but a critical assumption here is that one new individual is created per generation. This reflects (often) low reproduction rates with many endangered species, especially larger animals and mammals. "
